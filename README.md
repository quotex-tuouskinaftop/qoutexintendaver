## Quotex Trading Guide

Once you have logged in to your Quotex account, you will be able to

sections: the chart, the order form, and the account balance.

The \*\*chart\*\* displays the price history of the asset you are
trading. You can use the chart to identify trends and make trading
decisions.

The \*\*order form\*\* is where you can place your trades. You can
specify the amount you want to trade, the expiration time, and the type
of order you want to place.

The \*\*account balance\*\* displays the amount of money you have in
your account. You can use this information to manage your risk and make
sure you do not trade more than you can afford to lose.
